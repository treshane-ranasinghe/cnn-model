# Echo Twin CNN Model

This project contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in a Jupyter notebook (`echoTwin.ipynb`) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Structure

- `echoTwin.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with the CNN model code and training process.
- `data/`: CIFAR-10 dataset files used for training and testing.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and folders ignored by Git.

## Features

- CNN model training and evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Training loss tracking.
- Modular and easy-to-follow notebook.
